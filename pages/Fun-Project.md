<div class="post">

This is a cool project I am currently working on:

- [link](https://github.com/AlexCKunze/bash-site-gen)

This is extremely simple to use. If you want to change things like e.g., the navbar and footer, just go to the snippets folders.

**snippets/**

- start.html
- header.html
- footer.html
- end.html

To add new posts, all you have to do is run the manage.sh script

./manage.sh

- new <postname>
- edit <postname>
- delete <postname>

</div>
