<div class="post">

This is a cool project I am currently working on:

- [link](https://github.com/AlexCKunze/bash-site-gen)

This is extremely simple to use. If you want to change things like e.g., the navbar and footer, just go to the snippets folders.

**snippets/**

- start.html
- header.html
- footer.html
- end.html

**To run the script**

*chmod u+x kiwi.sh*

./kiwi.sh

-  --rebuild Rebuilds the site
-  --new *postname* Creates a new post as ./pages/*yourpostname*.md

**NOTE** This is a work in progress!
